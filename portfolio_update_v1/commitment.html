        <h2>Excellent Customer Service</h2>
        <p>There's more to building a website than just typing up the code. We all know that you're also looking for someone that cares about your organization or product.</p>
        <p>My commitment to you is that I'll treat your project with the utmost important, like it's my own project. You'll have what you're looking for on time from someone who answers the phone when you call.</p>

        <h2>Treat You Like A Person</h2>
        <p>Building a website can be extremely techincal. The jargon and techno speak can often be overwhelming. It even makes me feel out of place sometimes.</p>
        <p>I want you to know the whole time we are working together you'll be treated like the intelligent person you are. I'll answer your questions, respond to your emails, and even laugh at your jokes.</p>
